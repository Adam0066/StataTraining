#### Introduction   
We'll spend the first day learning about the fundamental building blocks for data analysis and dive into Stata, a statistical software package with powerful data process and analysis capabilities.


####  Part 1 Goals  
1. Understand the benefits of programming   
2. Develop an organized filing structure    
3. Become familiar with Stata software/ interface   
4. Read a Stata help file and know where to find additional help online

#### What to remember?  
1. **Comment, comment, comment**: Keep notes so future you knows what past you was thinking    
2. **Don't repeat yourself**: Instead of copying and pasting, create a program (function) to do repeated tasks
3. **Avoid hardcoding when possible**: Instead of setting the year to be 2016, create a scalar called year and set it to 2016   
4. **Plan ahead**: create an outline for what you will do and how your files will be organized before you start coding
