#### Introduction    
Unfortunately, most of the time spent doing 'data science' are the mundane, boring, and occasionally frustrating bits known as data wrangling.  


####  Part 2 Goals   
1. import data and identify data inconsistencies
2. break coding goals into small tasks
3. document your work using a .do file (script)
4. understand and execute routine data manipulation operations such as:  
- transformations (gen & egen)
- reshaping (melting & casting)
5. conduct basic summaries, tabulations and visualizations on the FAD data set

#### Exercises   
- Exercise 1: psuedocoding a task 
- Exercise 2: reshaping messy data into tidy data

#### Up next...
Now that we have a tidy dataset, we will learn how to combine data and conduct basic summary statistics and tabulations.
