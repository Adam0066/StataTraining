## Data Wrangling Basics
<br>

### Introduction
Unfortunately, most of the time spent doing 'data science' are the mundane, boring, and occasionally frustrating bits known as data wrangling.  


###  Part 2 Goals

1. import data and identify inconsistencies
2. break coding goals into small tasks
3. document your work using a .do file (script)
4. understand and execute routine data manipulation operations such as:  
- reshaping (melting & casting)
- combining data sets
- updating data sets
- transforming 
- summarizing
5. conduct basic summaries, tabulations and visualizations on the FAD data set

### Exercises
- Exercise 1: tidy 
- Exercise 2: merge data sets together (add hyperlink to content below)
- ...

#### Exercise 1
(provide intro)   
    `ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = cyl)) + geom_point()`

(show output, make comments.)

#### Homework

#### Answer Key

#### Up next...
Now that we have a tidy dataset, we'll see what we can do with it, analyzing the data and building regressions.
