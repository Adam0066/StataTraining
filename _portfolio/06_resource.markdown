### Useful Stata packages

### Useful R packages
R has a long list of libraries that extend the functionality of base R and make it easier to use.

Here's a running list of packages that we find particularly helpful. Core libraries are indicated with an asterix, and are particularly recommended for all users.

To install any of the packages, use `install.packages(<package name>)`
