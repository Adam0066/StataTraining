### Introduction  
In this session you will learn the basics of data management and analysis using Stata. The first part of the presentation will focus on combining datasets through the `append` and `merge` commands. Section two will introduce five commands to help you summarize and tabulate your data. The final part covers data export and how to automate routine tasks using loops.


####  Part 2 Goals  
1. combine datasets using append and merge
2. summarize datasets across different dimensions using:  
- summary
- tabulation
- table
- tabstat
- collapse
3. export data for use in other programs (Excel, Tableau, R,...)
4. automate tasks through loops


#### Exercises
- Exercise 1: Merge household data into individual data 
- Exercise 2: Collapse and summarizing foreign assistance data
- Exercise 3: Loop over household assets
- Exercise 4: Loop over geographic zones
- Exercise 5: Execute mathematical operations through loops

#### Up next...  
Now that we have learned about the fundamentals of data munging, we will move on to some principles of data visualization.
